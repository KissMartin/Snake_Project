Test Cases:

Game End:
- End the game when the snake hits the wall
- End the game when the snake hits his own tail when the length of the snake is greater than 5
- End the game with a win when the player reaches the maximum amount of points (apples)
- At the end of the game updates the highscore if the score is bigger than the current highscore

Game start:
- Spawns the player at the correct position
- There's always x amount of apples (depends on the option that the player chooses), within 0.5 seconds so its always respawns

Gameplay:
- Detect if the snake responds correctly to all the different inputs and input combinations
- Detect if the snake functions correctly, meaning it gathers the apple and increments its length by 1
- Detect if the snake's length gets incremented and the new body part spawns at the tail not the head
