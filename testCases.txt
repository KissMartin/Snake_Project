Test Cases:

Game End:
- End the game when the snake hits the wall
- End the game when the snake hits his own tail
- End the game with a win when the player reaches the maximum amount of points (apples)

Game start:
- There's always an apple on start

Gameplay:
- Detect if the snake responds correctly to all the different inputs and input combinations
- Detect if the snake functions correctly, meaning it gathers the apple and increments its length by 1
- There's always an other apple when you eat the current one
- The score gets updated as you eat the apples
